## About

**New Vegas Sharp** is a modular modlist for Fallout: New Vegas. It addresses a number of significant issues with the game:

- Bugs and stability: includes all major bug fixes released for the game so far, with an emphasis on squashing the most noticeable bugs.
- User interface: improved functionality and expanded hotkeys.
- Visuals: vanilla-friendly NPC and lighting improvements.
- Gameplay: basic quality of life improvements and rebalanced gameplay based around **SawyerBatty**, trying to adhere closely to the developer's intention.
- DLCs: reworked implementation, expansions delayed.

Because this modlist is offered "as is" and to be considered complete, I won't be answering compatibility questions.

## Frequently asked questions

### How much space do I need to install these mods?

Roughly 4.0GB.

### What are the major differences between New Vegas Sharp and Viva New Vegas?

It boils down to two differences:

- My guide is more extensive, as I believe anyone looking to mod Bethesda games shouldn't worry about the length of a mod list. If you are willing to install 50 compatible mods, you are probably willing to install a hundred.
- I don't remove mods based on people being unable to read. I'd rather have people learn to read than babysit them.

That's pretty much it.
