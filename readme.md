## About

**New Vegas Sharp** is a modular modlist for Fallout: New Vegas. It addresses a number of significant issues with the game:

- Bugs and stability: includes all major bug fixes released for the game so far, with an emphasis on squashing the most noticeable bugs.
- User interface: improved functionality and expanded hotkeys.
- Visuals: vanilla-friendly NPC and lighting improvements.
- Gameplay: basic quality of life improvements and rebalanced gameplay based around **SawyerBatty**, trying to adhere closely to the developer's intention.
- DLCs: reworked implementation, expansions delayed.

Because this modlist is offered "as is" and to be considered complete, I won't be answering compatibility questions.
