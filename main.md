# PREAMBLE

## Disclaimer

The guide presented here assumes you have already followed all instructions found in the [**Setup**](https://github.com/Sigourn/newvegas-sharp/blob/main/setup.md#new-vegas-setup) page, and are familiar with Mod Organizer 2, which we will be using to install the mods in this document. Please abstain from using this guide until you've correctly set up Fallout: New Vegas and the recommended tools.

## Installing mods appropriately

When installing a mod, use the name provided for it in the guide's hyperlink. For example, the guide lists the following mod's name as **Yukichigai Unofficial Patch - YUP**.

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/iheartnewvegas/main/modExample.png)

Whenever you install a mod in Mod Organizer 2, the mod manager assigns it a default name, which is either the name of the Nexus page from where it is being downloaded from, the name of the file, or a complete filename. When manually installing a mod, Mod Organizer 2 will always resort to its filename.

All files installed from a same Nexus page should be merged into a single mod when using Mod Organizer 2. They should also be merged in the order they are listed in this guide, to avoid potential problems (such as update files being overwritten by older files from a same mod). The rule of thumb to use is that one hyperlink in the guide = one single mod on your MO2's left pane.

By default, this guide will always require you to download the main file. On the occasion more specific instructions are required (e.g. multiple main files are present and you need directions, or additional files need to be installed) they will be provided.

> ℹ️ Load order dictates the priority a given mod's plugins have over the mods' plugins loaded before them. This is handled by **loadorder.txt**.

### Generating LOD

- Run **FNVLODGen** in MO2.
- Right click on the list of worldspaces, and click **Select All**.
- Click **Generate**. The process will take some time.
- After the **LOD Generator: finished (you can close this application now)** message appears, close the program.

Now all that's left is to install our generated LOD.

- Navigate to your **Fallout New Vegas Mods\FNVLODGen Output** folder, and make an archive out of the **textures** and **meshes** folder. Name it **FNVLODGen Output**.
- Install **FNVLODGen Output** with MO2.

- Set **Grenade Swap Hotkey** to **C**.

**RAD**:

> ℹ️ Sleep deprivation affects max AP; makes all needs affect max AP, with sleep deprivation setting in later than hunger and thirst; makes needs affect max AP at rates similar to how needs cause stat penalties; makes the former setting follow JSawyer's stat penalties progression.

### INI config

**falloutcustom.ini (Optional)**:
- Click the **Tools** ![Tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharp/master/MO_ini.png) button, and click **INI Editor**. Paste the following into **falloutcustom.ini**.

```
[Imagespace]
bDoDepthOfField=0

[Interface]
fDlgFocus=5.0000
