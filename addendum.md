Feel free to follow this guide in parallel to the main document, or, if you wish, follow it after finishing the main document. The correct mod order and load order, as well as slightly different **Finishing touches** instructions will be found at the end of this guide.

> ⚠️ ONLY INSTALL THIS MOD IF YOU'VE FOLLOWED THE **VISUALS** AND **LOD** SECTIONS TO THE LETTER. Else, you will have to generate your own LOD following the instructions in the following section.

> ℹ️ This file should be used *instead* of the **FNVLODGen Output** featured in the main guide.

## FINISHING TOUCHES

### Mod order and load order

[**I Heart New Vegas MO2 Profile Files**](https://github.com/Sigourn/iheartnewvegas/blob/main/I%20Heart%20New%20Vegas%20MO2%20Profile%20Files.7z)  
Adjusts mod order and load order for Left My Heart In New Vegas to work as intended.
- Extract the files into **C:\Games\Fallout New Vegas Mods\MO2\profiles\Left My Heart In New Vegas**, overwriting when prompted.

> ℹ️ Mod order dictates the priority a given mod's assets have over the mods installed before it. This is handled by **modlist.txt**.
 
> ℹ️ Load order dictates the priority a given mod's plugins have over the mods' plugins loaded before them. This is handled by **loadorder.txt**.

### Generating LOD

> ⚠️ Assuming you use a different mod setup than the one recommended in the guide, you will have to generate LOD yourself.

- Run **FNVLODGen** in MO2.
- Right click on the list of worldspaces, and click **Select All**. Uncheck **FreesideFortWorld "Old Mormon Fort"**.
- Click **Generate**. The process will take some time.
- After the **LOD Generator: finished (you can close this application now)** message appears, close the program.

> ⚠️ Having too many LOD mods installed can cause **FNVLODGen** to fail at generating LOD appropriately. At the moment, the only scenario where I've found this to happen is at the Old Mormon Fort. Hence why are generating its LOD separate from the rest of the worldspaces.

- Now disable the following mods:
  - **LOD Additions and Improvements**
  - **LOD Additions and Improvements YUP Patch**
  - **FNV LOD Supplementation**
  - **TCM's LOD Overhaul**
  - **Much Needed LOD**
  - **Much Needed LOD YUP Patch**
- Run **FNVLODGen** in MO2.
- Right click on the list of worldspaces, and click **Select None**. Check **FreesideFortWorld "Old Mormon Fort"**.
- Click **Generate**. The process will take some time.
- After the **LOD Generator: finished (you can close this application now)** message appears, close the program.

> ⚠️ Remember to re-enable the disabled LOD mods.

Now all that's left is to install our generated LOD.

- Navigate to your **Fallout New Vegas Mods\FNVLODGen Output** folder, and make an archive out of the **textures** and **meshes** folder. Name it **FNVLODGen Output**.
- Install **FNVLODGen Output** with MO2.
